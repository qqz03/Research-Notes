DC between residual attributes (R) and attributes of interest, if we use the ground truth CLIP labeled data to measure the attribute of interest.

## Requirements

![pytorch 1.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/pytorch-1.3-orange.svg)
![cuda 10.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/cuda-10.1-green.svg)

This repository imports modules from the StyleGAN2 architecture (**not pretrained**).
Clone the following repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch
```
Add the local StyleGAN2 project to PYTHONPATH. For bash users:
```
export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-stylegan2-project>
```

## Training
In order to train a model from scratch, do the following preprocessing and training steps.
First, create a directory (can be specified by `--base-dir` or set to current working directory by default) for the training artifacts (preprocessed data, models, training logs, etc).

### Zero-shot Disentangled Image Manipulation
For training a model on real images, without any manual annotations, first prepare an unlabeled image dataset. E.g. for FFHQ, download the [FFHQ dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset), create a local directory named `ffhq-dataset` with all the png images placed in a single `imgs` subdir, and apply the following preprocessing:
```
python main.py preprocess --dataset-id ffhq --dataset-path ffhq-dataset --out-data-name ffhq-x256
```

The images are then annotated in a zero-shot manner using [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). Clone the external repository and add to your local path:
```
git clone https://github.com/openai/CLIP
export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-clip-project>
```

For example, human face images can be annotated as follows:
```
python annotate_with_clip.py --data-name ffhq-x256 --K 1000
```

The model can then be trained as follows:
```
python main.py train --config ffhq_clip --data-name ffhq-x256 --model-name DC_Disentanglement
```

#### Resources
The training automatically detects all the available gpus and applies multi-gpu mode if available.

#### Logs
During training, loss metrics and translation visualizations are logged with tensorboard and can be viewed by:
```
tensorboard --logdir <base-dir>/cache/tensorboard --load_fast true
```

## Pretrained Models
We provide a model pretrained on human face images ([FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset)), with partial annotations obtained in a zero-shot manner using [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) for the following attributes: `age, gender, ethnicity, hair_color, beard, glasses`. Download the entire model directory from [distance_correlation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWmR04aQqi9OZJcrxfIajuJZJtSiUm1I/view?usp=sharing) and place it under `<base-dir>/cache/models`.

## Inference
Given a trained model (either pretrained or trained from scratch), a test image named as *input.png*, can be manipulated as follows:
```
bash evaluate.sh
```

**Note:** Face manipulation models are very sensitive to the face alignment. The target face should be aligned exactly as done in the pipeline which CelebA-HQ and FFHQ were created by. Use the alignment method implemented [here](https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/align_images.py) before applying any of the human face manipulation models on external images.

## Inference DC
Given a trained model (either pretrained or trained from scratch), we can measure the distance correlation between residual and attributes of interest
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python correlation_BERT.py evaluate --config ffhq_clip --data-name ffhq-x256 --model-name DC_Disentanglement 
```
